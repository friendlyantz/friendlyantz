<h1 align="center">🤠 G'Day! I'm Anton</h1>

I am a software engineer based in Melbourne, Australia.

I fell in love with 0s and 1s as a child but initially pursued Civil Engineering and High-Rise construction after school. After a decade, I rediscovered my passion and am now living the dream, building digital products and hoping to make the world a better place. 🧀

I am currently learning C/C++, Rust🦀 and FPGA hardware programming, while "Extreme Programming" / Test-Driving in Ruby and fast-shipping it daily🛳️.

I truly enjoy what I do.

I document my discoveries in the ['Learning']({% link _pages/learning.md %}) section. (By the way, this intro block was AJAX loaded using HTMX!)

> 1. don’t forget technical underpinnings - it’s not just about shipping code
> 1. always refactor - your first or second cut is never going to be perfect, be willing to keep improving the code
> 1. be critical of yourself and others - but not the people - create a robust culture where you can focus on ideas but be ready to let them go
