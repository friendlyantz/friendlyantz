<h1 align="center">🤠 G'Day! I'm Anton</h1>

I am a software engineer based in Melbourne, Australia.

I fell in love with 0s and 1s as a little kid but initially pursued Civil Engineering and High-Rise construction after school. After a decade, I rediscovered my passion and am now living the dream, building digital products and hoping to make the world a better place. 🧀

I focus on back-end/full-stack development and Machine Learning, and I truly enjoy what I do.

I am currently learning C/C++ and Rust🦀 while "Extreme Programming" in Ruby and fast-shipping code daily🛳️.

I document my discoveries in the ['Learning']({% link _pages/learning.md %}) section. (By the way, this intro block was AJAX loaded using HTMX!)
