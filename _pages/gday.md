<h1 align="center">ðŸ¤  G'Day! I'm Anton</h1>

Iâ€™m a fullstack software engineer, based in Melbourne, Australia.

I switched into tech after more than a decade in Civil Engineering and Project Management consulting - I rediscovered
  my passion and living the dream now, building digital products and hoping to make the world a better place. ðŸ§€

I am focused on back-end / full-stack and Machine Learning. I very much enjoy what I do.

I keep my discoveries in ['Learning']({% link _pages/learning.md %}) section. (_btw, this intro block was ajax loaded using HTMX!_)
