<h1 align="center">ðŸ¤  G'Day! I'm Anton</h1>
I'm a fullstack software engineer, based in Melbourne, Australia.

I switched into tech after more than a decade in Civil Engineering and Project Management consulting - I rediscovered my passion and living the dream now, building digital products and hoping to make the world a better place.

I am focused on back-end, Data Science, Machine Learning and ML ops. I very much enjoy what I do


### How I'd define myself...literally

```ruby
class Anton
  def initialize
    @name = 'Anton Paneleev'
    @dob = "1987-04-01T04:15:00"
    @work = 'Full-Stack Software Engineer and Data Scientist'
    @education = [ 'Auckland University of Technology',
                   'Moscow State University of Civil Engineering',
                   'Le Wagon' 
                  ]
    @hobbies = [  'Kitesurfing', 
                  'Camping',
                  'Motorcycling',
                  'Longboarding'
                ]
  end

  def current_location
    'Melbourne, Australia'
  end

  def previous_locations
    [ 'Brisbane, Australia',
      'Auckland, New Zealand',
      'Moscow, Russia'

  end
end
```
