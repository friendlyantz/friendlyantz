"The Mother of All Demos" is a name given retrospectively to Douglas
Engelbart's December 9, 1968, demonstration of experimental computer
technologies that are now commonplace. The live demonstration featured the introduction of the computer mouse, video conferencing, teleconferencing, hypertext, word processing, hypermedia, object addressing and dynamic file linking, bootstrapping, and a collaborative real-time editor."
