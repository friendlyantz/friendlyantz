# Adam Boas wisdom: 3 tips from a great engineer and leader

I had a privilage to work with a great engineer and leader - Adam Boas, I asked him for 3 tips for fellow professionals:
> 1. don’t forget technical underpinnings - it’s not just about shipping code
> 1. always refactor - your first or second cut is never going to be perfect, be willing to keep improving the code
> 1. be critical of yourself and others - but not the people - create a robust culture where you can focus on ideas but be ready to let them go
