BUT, you might still want to invest in learning some basic shortcuts of EMACS, as VI binding are not always available, also look further into [ReadLine](https://readline.kablamo.org/emacs.html)

Shortcuts I use on Mac that I think are useful and does not cause conflicts with other shortcuts(Note: `Alt` is `Option` key):

|Command|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Ctrl-a|Move to the start of the current line.|
Ctrl-e|Move to the end of the line.
Alt-f|Move forward to the end of the next word. Words are alphanumeric.
Alt-b|Move back to the start of the current or previous word. Words are alphanumeric.
Ctrl-l|Clear the screen.
|||
Ctrl-k|Kill (cut) forwards to the end of the line.
Ctrl-u|Kill (cut) backwards to the start of the line.

Alt-d|Kill (cut) forwards to the end of the current word.
