# Config
```sh
# configure jj 
jj config set --user user.name "Anton"
jj config set --user user.email "anton@email.com"
jj config edit --user
# (or via )
nvim ~/.config/jj/config.toml
```

Also no pager flag is great
```sh
--no-pager
# or set it permanently
jj config set --user ui.paginate never
```
# set up git repo tracking
```sh
# set up jj repo and track trunk. jj bookmark is like a branch
jj git init --colocate
jj bookmark track master@origin
```
# make changes
```sh
echo "some stufff" >> README.md
# this will be saved in a separate commit on top of master, which will be constantly amended to reflect you WIP

# in order to push you need a commit message
jj describe
```
# Push
```sh
# update parent/trunk
jj git fetch
# rebase current commit to main
jj rebase -s @ -d master

# move main bookmark
jj bookmark set master
jj git push
```
