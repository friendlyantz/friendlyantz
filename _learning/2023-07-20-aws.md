# AWS

## IAM

- Never use `root`
- Sort out IAM users and roles (can be JSONed)
- Generate access keys for CLI (NEVER SHARE)

```sh
aws configure
aws iam list-users
```
- [ ] Assign MFA

### Roles

- EC2 and Lamba mainly

### IAM Security Tools

- [ ] [IAM Credentials Report](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_getting-report.html)
- [ ] [IAM Access Advisor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html)
  - use to upd policies
  - IAM -> User -> Access Advisor (tab)

## Budgeting

1. You need to set up billing acces as `root` user to other users first: top-right -> Account -> IAM user and role access to Billing information -> Activate IAM Access
2. as IAM user go to account -> billing
- Free Tier - forecasting
- Budgets
