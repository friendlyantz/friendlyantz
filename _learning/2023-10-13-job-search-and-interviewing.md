# Interview Parts / personal notes

I found applying for a new job consists of a few stages:

1. initial screening with HR
2. screening with hiring manager
3. technical challenge
4. system design challenge
5. behavioral
6. offer / negotiations

## Algorithms and big O understanding

- [Algo primer](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/) or any other resource that will teach you basic data structure and search algos(don't need to go deep into exotic algos). Understand what is static and dynamic Arrays / String, Hasmap, Ring buffer, basic search and sorting algorithms
- together with algos establish an understanding of [Big-O complexities for both space and time](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/), [another bigO resource](https://cooervo.github.io/Algorithms-DataStructures-BigONotation/index.html).

## Practice code challanges

- [ ] Then practice on LeetCode(quite advanced, gives you bigO performance), HackerRank(okish, some companies use it's interface for live coding), CodeWars, InterviewCake. [This guy created a fantastic tree of the hottest tech challanges](https://neetcode.io/) - focus on completeing these, rather than just doing every exercise on leetcode, etc
- [ ] Putting MAJOR effort with any coding assignments, that provide a test suite, and that you have the assignment reviewed before submitting.

# System Design

- [system design interview prep](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
- [anki flash card app for system design](https://apps.ankiweb.net/``)
- Design Data Intensive book - quite rich, but gives a lot of food for thought for modern distributed system design that will put you way ahead of competition and powerpoint architects

I noted many interviewers don't always know whatr they are talking about and ask questions for the sake of asking, so don't be discouraged if they don't get your response - software design is quite abstract topic, and not eveyone prepared to hear different solutions / answers.

# offer

Review the contracts, trust but verify. HR assurances that 'we have nothing unusual in our contracts' is a red flag. When you have nothing to hide, you don't have to emphasase it - I had multiple issues of illegal clauses accompanied by these assurances. HR is not your friend in most cases

time to think: start ups need a descision quick, sometimes in 3-5working days.
