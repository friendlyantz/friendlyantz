[Superb Tutorial, however I put some additional notes below](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCjuiIswXGs&list=PLT98CRl2KxKHnlbYhtABg6cF50bYa8Ulo)

## VM >>> Containers

* You can migrate VMs between clusters w/o shutting them down;
* Containers are more suitable if you have limited resources and are very efficient on RAM;
* Not all apps will run properly in containers;
* Some vendors have stigma against containers;

# Linux VM

I used [Debian](https://www.debian.org/download), other distros failed to install (Ubuntu server, Parrot OS Arch)

## 'Create New VM' Options:

- [ ] Disk: change Bus from SCSI to VirtIO Block (fastest) and enable 'Discard'
- [ ] CPU: type -> `host`

## Post Install:

- [ ] Unmount boot CD --> VM Hardware
- [ ] Install SSH
enable root access for users if you want
```sh
sudo usermod -aG sudo friendlyantz
```
- [ ] Enable QEMU Guest Agent: `sudo apt install qemu-guest-agent`

# Generic tips
- [ ] disable 'use tablet for pointer' if you don't use OS GUI --> VM Options
- [ ] Separate Proxmox management network from VM networks
- [ ] Enable start VM at boot if required --> Options
- [ ] VM a CD / iso to transfer files between machines (WIP)
