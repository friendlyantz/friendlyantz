### Installation

Short vid on private network config on proxmox (you might need to forward DNS in pfsense - see video below)

### DNS Redirect for LAN

> if you want to specify DNS server: 
> 	Services -> DHCP Server -> DNS Servers
> 
Check DNS Leak:
- https://www.dnsleaktest.com/
- https://whoer.net/
- `curl https://ifconfig.co/json`

1. Check your DNS: Status -> Interfaces
2. Set: System -> General Setup

|            | Prime             | Secondary         |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| CloudFlare | 1.1.1.1           | 1.0.0.1           |
| Troogle    | 8.8.8.8           | 8.8.4.4           |
| OpenDNS    | 208.67.222.222    | 208.67.220.220    |
| NordVPN    | 103.86.96.100<br> | 103.86.99.100<br> |
3. Services: DNS Resolver
4. Firewall -> NAT ->Add
	1. Protocol: TCP/UDP
	2. Destination: Invert match. of your LAN interface
	3. Redirect target IP: `127.0.0.1`
5. Check and relocate Firewall RUle to highest priority for DNS?: 
	1. Status -> DNS Resolver
	2. Firewall
	3. 

### VPN

- [Great Tutorial on defining FireWall/Aliases/etc rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulRgecz0UsQ)
#### NordVPN
- [terrible video tutorial - use it only to configure openVPN with NordVPN cred's, don't set rules/etc according to it.(stop at minute 5)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AouyT76yMmU) 
	- - [Nord VPN links](https://github.com/Steven-D-Morgan/Morgans_Modifications/blob/main/pfSense/NordVPN_Setup.md)
1. Add Certificate  (only need one per provider)
2. Add VPN Client
	1. Server host or address: 
	2. Client Certificate: GUI default or whatever
	3. Username/Pass: not your NordVPN email - find it in WebUI setting in NordVPN
	4. TLS Configuration:  
		1. Use a TLS Key
		2. NO=Automatically generate a TLS Key.
			1. import yours from NordVPN file (they are all the same across endpoints)
	5. Data Encryption Algorithms:
		1. `AES-256-GCM`
		2. `AES-256-CBC`
		Fallback:  `AES-256-GCM`
	5. Auth digest algorithm `SHA512`
	6. Don't add/remove routes: `YES`
	7. Don't pull routes: `YES` (IMPORTANT)
	8. Exit Notify: Disabled
	9. Gateway creation: ipv4
	10. Verbosity level:3
	11. Custom options:
```
tls-client;
remote-random;
tun-mtu 1500;
tun-mtu-extra 32;
mssfix 1450;
persist-key;
persist-tun;
reneg-sec 0;
remote-cert-tls server;
```

```
auth-retry interact; ????
```
3. check open VPN client worked and ONLINE
4. Assign Interface to it, so we can use as a Gateway. (YOU WILL USE THESE ASSIGNMENTS TO CHANGE VPN LOCATIONS; you might need to `Status / OpenVPN: Restart service` after switch)
5. OPTIONAL: System -> Routing -> Gateway: edit Monitor IP: i.e. `9.9.9.9`, NordVPN puts it's own\
6. Firewall -> NAT -> Outbound -> Add Rule
	1. Interface
	2. Source: `192.168.3.0` or you LAN in pfSense you want to target
	3. Address of interface
7. Firewall / Aliases
8. Firewall / Rules -> Add
	1. Protocol `any`
	2. Source: your alias or IP
	3. Desc:
	4. Display adfvanced: 
		1. Tag: `you_tag` - tag for the packets (copy-to-paste it )
	5. Gateway: 


#### Debugging:
    1. Status / OpenVPN: Restart service
    2. Status/Filter Reload

NordVPN DNS Servers (wasn't neccassary)
```
103.86.96.100
103.86.99.100
```

# Packages

SystemPackage ManagerPackage Installer:
- [ ] Service WatchDog
### Legacy notes:
1. Proxmox ---> Ensure you create a virtual network bridge that you can use as LAN for PFSense, because as soon as you create another WLAN / network firewall will block all you from accessing original ETH/WAN ip address
1. pfSense/Interfaces: Create new LAN assigngment for your LAN bridge
1. pfSense/Interfaces: Create new OPT assigngment for your WLAN
1. DHCP Server: Enable DHCP server for WLAN
