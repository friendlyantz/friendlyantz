# Indexing

{% include video id="zMwV0-8J01Q" provider="youtube" %}

## How to speed it up

- settings -> project structure: disable what's neccessary to index
- disable plugins
- try Shared Project Indexes plugin
- don't open RM in different windows, open project in Ruby Mine instances
- consider `git worktree`

```sh
git worktree add ../project-dev dev
rubimine.sh ../project-dev
```

- Memory Setting -> increase it!
- user light-edit mode for readmes, etc. it won't load all IDE smart features

```sh
rubymine.sh -e README.md
```
