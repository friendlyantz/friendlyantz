# Download specific dir from a GitHub repo

```sh
apt install subversion
```

IMPORTANT for `master` replace `tree/master` part of URL with `trunk`. Trust this is 

> https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/master/test âžœ
> https://github.com/lodash/lodash/trunk/test

```sh
svn checkout https://github.com/friendlyantz/complete-javascript-course/trunk/07-Pig-Game/
```

- If you're interested in `foo` branch, use `branches/foo` instead. The full path looks like branches/foo/foldername
- Protip: You can use `svn ls` to see available tags and branches before downloading if you wish

# GitIgnore / Stop tracking

## completely remove file from git tracking
```sh
echo '*.bin' >> .gitignore
git rm --cached path/to/your/file.bin
```

Or just 
## stop tracking changes, but keep it in `git`
```sh
git update-index --assume-unchanged path/to/your/file.bin
```
