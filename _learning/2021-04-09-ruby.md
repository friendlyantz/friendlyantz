## Incline execution
```sh
ruby -e puts 'Hello, world!'
rake -e puts 'Hello, world!'
```

## File writing

```ruby
%W[ch1.md ch2.md ch3.md].each do |md_file|
  html_file = File.basename(md_file, ".md") + ".html"
  file html_file => md_file do
    sh "pandoc -o #{html_file} #{md_file}"
  end
end
```

I had to call with `.html`, not `.md`, which was a bit confusing.
Now rake handles file writing and trackes if there are any updates in `.md` file worth calling a conversion operation
```sh
❯ rake md_to_html README.html
pandoc -o README.html README.md
❯ rake md_to_html README.html
❯ rake md_to_html README.html
```

### using Rules

unlike previous commit this rule defines a saving
RULE for files with .html extension with prerequisite 'md' file, so the
rake initially looks for a rule with exact match of `README.html`, doesn't
find and then goes to generic '.html' rule
Previously with used `file` task, with explicit name of the file
```ruby
rule '.html' => '.md' do |t| 
  if `which pandoc`.empty?
    puts 'pandoc is not installed'
    exit 1
  end
  sh "pandoc -o #{t.name} #{t.source}"
end
```

### Listing files

```ruby
files = Rake::FileList['**/*.md']
files.exclude('**/~*') # exclude files with ~ in the name
files.exclude do |file|
  `git ls-files #{file}`.empty? # exclude files that are not tracked by git
end
files.exclude /^ignoredir/ # using REGEX
```

OR create instance of a file list and pass a block 

```ruby
files = Rake::FileList.new('**/*.md') do |fl|
  fl.exclude('**/~*') # exclude files with ~ in the name
  fl.exclude do |file|
    `git ls-files #{file}`.empty? # exclude files that are not tracked by git
  end
  fl.exclude(/^ignoredir/) # using REGEX
  fl.exclude(/README/) # using REGEX
end
```
#### listing files with new file ext

```ruby
files.ext('html')
```

# Exercism takeaways

[GitHub exercism/ruby solutions with some comments in commit](https://github.com/friendlyantz/exercism/tree/master/ruby)
Interesting exercises:
- Two Fer
- Resistor Color Duo

### `class` vs `instance` methods

The class level method is there for convenience only, and it should stay inflexible, as it is there for convenience not power. We will see this decision in use in our "expansion", below.

### Hash freezing and I18N connection

The languages available and the translations available should be a single thing, a Hash. Otherwise there more of a chance that things can become disconnected in the way that they are now related, (but not connected).

### `then` as a circuit breaker
```ruby
# meets condition, no-op
1.then.detect(&:odd?)            # => 1
# does not meet condition, drop value
2.then.detect(&:odd?)            # => nil
```

## Progress Bar with custom style 

```ruby
      progressbar = ProgressBar.create(
        total: Ladida.count,
        format: "%a %e %P% %b\u{15E7}%i RateOfChange: %r Processed: %c from %C",
        progress_mark: " ",
        remainder_mark: "\u{FF65}",
      )

# in loop just do
progressbar.increment
```
