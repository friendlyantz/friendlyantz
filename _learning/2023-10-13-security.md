# MacOS MAC address spoofing

```sh
ifconfig en0 | grep ether

sudo ifconfig en0 down
sudo ifconfig en0 ether aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
# replace mac with your desired one or generate it:

# Subresource Integrity - SRI Hash

always Sign your CDN content
<https://www.srihash.org>

Ruby on Rails:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/you_content.cdn" integrity="your-sri-hash-here" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

> Keep in mind that SRI hashes are specific to a version of a resource. If the CDN resource gets updated, you'll need to generate a new SRI hash for the updated version and replace it in your HTML.
