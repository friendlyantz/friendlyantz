## On Server

### Install

```

# below might be required
# sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

### Authorize Keys

```bash
mkdir .ssh
chmod 700 .ssh
vim .ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 authorized_keys
# paste in the public key
```

### Disable Password

```bash
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

```vim
PasswordAuthentication no
```

```bash
sudo service ssh restart
```

### Debug / See logs on the Server on who connected via SSH

```bash
# opt 1: redundant / superseded by opt 2
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
# opt 2
sudo journalctl -f -u ssh.service
# where -f is to follow / live tail
```
