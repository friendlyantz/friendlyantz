# Setup Client (where you want to connect from)

## Generate ssh keys backed up by hardware key U2F

Traditionally we would generate ssh keys using `ssh-keygen ` and then copy the public key to the server. For example:
```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 # ed25519 is  most secure algorythm atm # tip: cd into ~/.ssh dir before running this
# or
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa # less secure
```
This is not secure as the private key is stored on the client and if the client is compromised then the attacker can use the private key to connect to the server.

To mitigate this we can use a hardware key to store the private key. Hardware kyes are supported by OpenSSH 8.2 and above.

There are two types of ssh keys 
- Discoverable(aka resident keys) (less secure) - the private key is stored on the hardware key and is always available
- Non-Discoverable (more secure) - the private key is stored on the hardware key but is not always available. The private key is only available when the hardware key is plugged in.

### Using Yubikey 
`ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk` # most secure # tip: cd into ~/.ssh dir before running this

`-sk` means hardware key
### Using Flipper Zero

Flipper Zero supports only `ecdsa-sk`

# Setup Server

(where you want to connect to)

## Install

```bash
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
```

```bash
sudo service ssh start
# below might be required
# sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

## Authorize Keys

```bash
mkdir .ssh
chmod 700 .ssh
vi .ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 authorized_keys
# paste your public key content from the client
```

## Disable Password (IMPORTANTðŸš¨)


in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` update

```yaml
PasswordAuthentication no
```

> (or OPTIONALLY (and not recommended) do it here `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf` to override `root` settings if on Ubuntu/Debian and you want to keep default config allowing passwords - will be applied to other accounts
(IMPORTANT: Note `sshd_config`(server) NOT `ssh_config`(client), *.conf NOT*.config)
[refer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/727492/passwordauthentication-no-but-i-can-still-login-by-password)):

then(IMPORTANTðŸš¨)
```bash
# Note that this operations can be silent if linux doesn't have the service installed
systemctl restart sshd  # used this on Proxmox
# OR
sudo systemctl restart ssh # Debian, sshd didn't work
# or
sudo service ssh restart # used in Parrot OS
```
then(IMPORTANTðŸš¨)
triple check you can't still log in with password. Also, I noted changes might take time even after restrting server.

### Debug ssh service

```sh
systemctl status ssh.service
```

### Debug / See logs on the Server on who connected via SSH

```bash
# opt 1: redundant / superseded by opt 2
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
# opt 2
sudo journalctl -f -u ssh.service
# where -f is to follow / live tail
```

# Copy files using `rsync` or `scp`(deprecated)

```sh
# From client
rsync -e 'ssh' -avz ./local_filenam_on_client SSH_ADDRESS:/path/to/remote_file
#  from remote server
scp SSH_ADDRESS:/path/to/remote_file optional_local_filename
```
Both rsync and scp are command-line tools for transferring files over a network.

rsync is a more powerful and versatile tool than scp. It can synchronize files between two directories, and it can transfer files over a network while preserving file permissions, ownership, and timestamps. rsync is particularly useful for transferring large files or large numbers of files, as it can resume interrupted transfers and only transfer files that have changed since the last transfer.

scp (Secure Copy) is a simpler tool that is used to securely transfer files between two hosts. It uses the same SSH protocol as ssh to authenticate and encrypt the connection, and it can transfer files either from a remote host to a local host or from a local host to a remote host.

In summary, if you need to transfer a few files securely between two hosts, scp may be sufficient. However, if you need to transfer large amounts of data, or if you need to synchronize directories between two hosts, rsync is a better option.
