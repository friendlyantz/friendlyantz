My notes on learnings C, in preparation to learn Rust.

I want to dive into Assembly and C/C++, before appreciating the Rust

# Action Plan

- [ ] ~~finish [The C Programming book](https://www.cc4e.com/book/)~~ - rather a historical book, and nobody writes this [style of C anymore](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38827136)
- [ ] [2025 FCC course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xND0t1pr3KY)
## Ruby + C pathways
- [ ] Ruby + C: watch this by Jeremy Evans - I believe he mentions this is a good way to get started in writing some C for Ruby [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_1iqQOkv1E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_1iqQOkv1E)
- [ ] Puma also needs some programmers as Nate Berkopec mentioned in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SquGNt4FhY0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SquGNt4FhY0)
- [ ] You could also look at contributions to something small like mrubyc, here is an example of what the idea of UTF-8 being added was like
	- [ ] as a video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5rGatij0DE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5rGatij0DE)
	- [ ] and as code [https://github.com/mrubyc/mrubyc/commits?author=ima1zumi](https://github.com/mrubyc/mrubyc/commits?author=ima1zumi)
- [ ] or MRuby where Matz is doing a bunch of stuff [https://github.com/mruby/mruby](https://github.com/mruby/mruby)
- [ ] also you could write a gem in ruby that has an extension built in C using FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
	- [ ] like this for example [https://github.com/tyler/trie](https://github.com/tyler/trie)

- [ ] finally follow what people who are active and good at C do like Samuel Williams - [https://github.com/ioquatix](https://github.com/ioquatix) - he wrote a C library for RedBubble to very quickly put images on 3D objects
# C++
best book for learning C++ (according to Mike M) 
- [ ] [https://github.com/sheryllan/Notes/blob/master/Accelerated%20C++%20-%20Andrew%20Koenig%20&%20Barbara%20E.%20Moo.pdf](https://github.com/sheryllan/Notes/blob/master/Accelerated%20C++%20-%20Andrew%20Koenig%20&%20Barbara%20E.%20Moo.pdf)
- [ ] some call it a bit out dated
- [ ] but it's short and to the point
- [ ] Reddit says this book is still valid as a quick way to get up and going [https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/7io26m/is_accelerated_c_outdated/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/7io26m/is_accelerated_c_outdated/)
