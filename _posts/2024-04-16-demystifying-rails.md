# Rake / Rakefile / Raketasks

Rake is a build automation tool written in Ruby. It allows you to specify tasks and describe dependencies as well as to group tasks in a namespace.

Rake is similar to Make in Unix. However, Rake uses Ruby syntax, which allows for more flexibility and complexity in defining tasks.
