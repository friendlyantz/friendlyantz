Mike's advice:
1. finish the exercism ciricumiul for Ruby <https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby/concepts>
1. watch the parts of Rails to learn video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXwRs-FwcmE>
1. and learn each part separately as per my shitty blog <https://failure-driven.com/post/2022-12-15-ruby-conf-thailand-conference-notes/>
- learn the parts
- rake
- rack
- ActiveSupport
- hash_with_indifferent_access gotchas
- ActiveRecord
- ActiveModel
- ActiveMailer - running as standalone mailer
- ActiveJob
- others are too intertwined dependencies on the rest of rails to run individually: ActionCable, ActionVeiew, ActionController - these are better run inside rails
- DSLs in rails/ruby - RSpec, Routes
- Routes: sinatra/hanami/Roda better for
- templates: ERB
- dissecting-rails book/site

and if you need more - Hanami, Roda, ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
