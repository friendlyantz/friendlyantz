Mike's advice:
> 1. finish the exercism ciricumiul for Ruby <https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby/concepts>
> 1. watch the parts of Rails to learn video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXwRs-FwcmE>
> 1. and learn each part separately as per my shitty blog <https://failure-driven.com/post/2022-12-15-ruby-conf-thailand-conference-notes/>
> - learn the parts
> - rake
> - rack
> - ActiveSupport
> - hash_with_indifferent_access gotchas
> - ActiveRecord
> - ActiveModel
> - ActiveMailer - running as standalone mailer
> - ActiveJob
> - others are too intertwined dependencies on the rest of rails to run individually: ActionCable, ActionVeiew, ActionController - these are better run inside rails
> - DSLs in rails/ruby - RSpec, Routes
> - Routes: sinatra/hanami/Roda better for
> - templates: ERB
> - dissecting-rails book/site
> 
> and if you need more - Hanami, Roda, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
