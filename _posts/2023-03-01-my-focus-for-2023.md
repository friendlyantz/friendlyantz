Mike's advice:
> 1. finish the exercism ciricumiul for Ruby <https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby/concepts>
> 1. watch the parts of Rails to learn video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXwRs-FwcmE>
> 1. and learn each part separately as per my sh**ty blog <https://failure-driven.com/post/2022-12-15-ruby-conf-thailand-conference-notes/>
> - learn the parts
> - rake
> - rack
> - ActiveSupport
> - hash_with_indifferent_access gotchas
> - ActiveRecord
> - ActiveModel
> - ActiveMailer - running as standalone mailer
> - ActiveJob
> - others are too intertwined dependencies on the rest of rails to run individually: ActionCable, ActionVeiew, ActionController - these are better run inside rails
> - DSLs in rails/ruby - RSpec, Routes
> - Routes: sinatra/hanami/Roda better for
> - templates: ERB
> - dissecting-rails book/site
> 
> and if you need more - Hanami, Roda, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Tom's advice:

- Focus on a feature and observe it's performance over time and take ownership of it
- There are still opportunities for good product engineers / managers with solid engineering skills -> look for companies whos CTO and ideally CEO are technical
- [Square Growth Framework](https://developer.squareup.com/blog/squares-growth-framework-for-engineers-and-engineering-managers/)
- Continue book DDIA.
- go deeper in DB / PostgreSQL, Big Query
- Design Patterns - Familiarise yourself and applly them at work, since you sepnd more time at work than on side projects
- Books:
    - [The Mystical Man-Month](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)
    - [Peopleware](https://www.amazon.com.au/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Tom-DeMarco/dp/0321934113)
    - [Shapeup / Basecamp book](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) - appetite and 50/50curve are interesting, but read it all (later, focus on tech first)
