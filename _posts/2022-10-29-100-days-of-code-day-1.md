Joining @saramic with his [100 Days of Code challange](https://saramic.github.io/100-days-of-code/code/2022/10/29/day-1.html)

Fasting, exercising and coding seems like a universal fomula for success and happiness as everythings seems to follow through if you do these 3 simple steps ;D

Don't know where to start with coding - so many exciting ideas and projects, here what I think I will do:
1. prepere my 1st talk at Ruby /RoRo Melbourne meetup - will start simple - a GitHub user profile repo, but I might overcomplicate things with BDD and emojilanng or ...?
1. try a functional language - already started peaking into Elixir, a sister language to Ruby, which I love
1. hack my own wifi Network and open my garage door(which key was lost) with a [Flippper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) + ESP32 dev board which I can't wait to receive very soon. [RougeMaster](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins) firmware for flipper + [Marauder](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/Flipper-Zero) for wifi biz via ESP32 4tw ðŸ‘¾
1. build CO2 sensor /alarm with Raspberry Pico W
1. Contribute to a Scientist / Refactorly project
1. try `mruby` maybe and flash it on PicoW or esp32?
1. try [just](https://github.com/casey/just) tool - alternative to the glorios `make`. It seems to be more friendly for beginners in some edge /challanging cases, and why not to try something new? It does not come by default in unix, sorry Mike.
1.  Advent of code - 2021: Continue and hopefully finish; 2022: coming in December, holy gang of musketeers help me
