It has been two years now since I switched into tech/quit commercial consulting, here is the gist:
joined FinTech world, 1st promotion before probation, 1st burnout, deepened security mindset, TDD, BDD and DDD understanding, developed taste for a functional-style programming, working with true professionals, learning a lot and truly loving what I do.

Key learnings:
 - Always ask "Why" and question the purpose of the work - is this really the best/shortest route towards the goal(s), what are they?
 - Take responsibility and the weight of the world on your shoulders, where it belongs. Strive to be the best, remember: "He who has a 'Why', can bear almost any how" F. Nietzsche

Observations and Future trends:
- We are in the Bronze Age of Information Technology - we made a lot of discoveries, we developed first schools of thought and several programming paradigms over the last 50-70years, but are still very far away from the Newtonian revolution era when a common vector / structure started to emerge.
- AI took over graphical design already, I believe government and enterprise management could be the next. There will be a new paradigm of interaction / work / collaboration between humans and AI. Humankind deserves a better management. But there is a difference between management and leadership, and AI won't tackle both... or would it?
