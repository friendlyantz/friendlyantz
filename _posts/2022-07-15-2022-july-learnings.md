1. __Invest in touch-typing__ - keeps the flow of thinking and focus on important bits. Your ideas will magically flow onto the screen
1. __User default setup / minimal customization__ - start working straight away on any system / remote server without being slowed down by unfamiliar environment. `vi`-bindings in terminal / `REPL`, `tmux` are some of the tools worth learning
1. __BDD (Behavior-driven development)__ - formulate your ideas, _Why are you doing this?_ start with tests!
1. __Outside-in__ - start with high level tests, and once they stop providing you a frequent feedback (like "hot-cold") move onto lower-level / unit tests
