Very excited to join software engineering & data science industry and work on delivering meaningful outcomes again.

I have rediscovered my passion and was waiting for this moment for quite some time, following more than a decade-long career in construction project management consulting, trying to bring in engineering excellence, cut paper pushing and low resolution non-thinking that follows, with varying success.

Now I am very happy to have a meaningful career again, work with like-minded professionals and drive innovation, not the paperwork.

The learning curve was rather steep, but very well worth the effort. So thank you all who supported and motivated me!
