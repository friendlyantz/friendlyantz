Day 2:

Played for the first time with `emojicode` - a fun example of an [esoteric language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language):
> _"...a programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, as a hacking interface to another language (particularly functional programming or procedural programming languages), or as a joke."_

Last Ruby Meetup reminded and inspired me to play with it, also 'hacking' and it's error handling sounds like funðŸŽ‰ðŸ™€

Other languages I was considering were `Piet`, [Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_programming_language) and `Chef` - because I love art, literature and cooking ðŸ˜‚

I recon if you are a true and curious engineer - you definetly should play with some esoteric lang.
