# Tom's advice:

- Focus on a feature and observe it's performance over time and take ownership of it
- There are still opportunities for good product engineers / managers with solid engineering skills -> look for companies whos CTO and ideally CEO are technical
- Continue book DDIA.
- go deeper in DB / PostgreSQL, Big Query
- Design Patterns - Familiarise yourself and applly them at work, since you spend more time at work than on side projects
- Books:
    - [The Mystical Man-Month](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)
    - [Peopleware](https://www.amazon.com.au/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Tom-DeMarco/dp/0321934113)
    - [Shapeup / Basecamp book](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) - appetite and 50/50curve are interesting, but read it all (later, focus on tech first)
