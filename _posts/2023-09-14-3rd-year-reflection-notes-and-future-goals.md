It has been three years now since I switched into tech, here is the gist:

My reflections on the 3rd year in tech:
1. Your words carry tremendous weight!
2. In the journey of becoming a well-rounded engineer, consider adopting a 'T-shaped' approach.
3. Short-term vision and lack of ethics are disheartening, but there is hope...

1. I've discovered that a few remarks from seasoned engineers have propelled me
   into exploring various fascinating avenues. I've delved into Unix concepts,
   become proficient with Vim, discovered OpenTelemetry, Queuing Theory,
   explored HTMX, ventured into the realm of BDD, navigated the intricacies of
   SSH/tunneling / cybersecurity, and dived headfirst into the world of system
   design.

2. Experiment broadly to gain a wide array of skills, but also focus and
   specialize. This dual approach not only fosters synergy but also provides a
   holistic understanding of technologies. Yet, it's the mastery of a specific
   niche that truly empowers you and makes you an unstoppable force.

3. The current landscape of tech, overloaded by powerpoint experts, often
   prioritizing short-term gains, sometimes at the expense of ethics, leaving
   those passionate about long-term projects disheartened. However, there's a
   glimmer of hope â€“ there are still tech companies out there guided by tech
   enthusiasts, who remain dedicated to making a positive impact. Consider
   aligning yourself with them, work hard and dont give up.   Doing a
   meaningful and fulfilling work does not cause burnouts.
